# LootSpecManager

This addon is a fork of [LootSpecManager](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/lootspecmanager) by [gegenschall](https://www.curseforge.com/members/gegenschall) and will add several improvements to it and keep it up to date with the latest version.

The intended way to configure a loot spec is to open the Dungeon Journal (Ctrl+J) and navigate to individual bosses in dungeons or the dungeon overview page. In the top right corner, right next to the difficulty drop down, you will find a new dropdown button that allows to change the targeted loot spec for each encounter or M+ dungeon. Changing the value will persist over multiple sessions, just like the old configuration would allow for.

Additionally, the addon now makes use of configuration profiles. By default, a per character profile will be generated on first launch, but you can also create custom profiles and link them with any number of characters you like. This functionality is similar to the profile settings of ElvUI.

## Palanned features
- Raid Auto spec update
